# ActivityMonitoringService
This is the project for the front-end interface and web controllers for our activity monitoring service.

Install the Bootstrap 3 Plugin (https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7572-bootstrap-3) for the IntelliJ IDEA IDE. This will allow you to easy enter code snippets into the html pages.

The scope of this project is the front end service for the Smart Home Activity Monitoring System. The goal is to provide a web interface for different types of users who will access and utilize the data about a given smart home resident differently. This front end will be eventually connected to a data generator, be that a simulation or a real system.
